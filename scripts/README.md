##### Brief description of scripts:
The usage for each script is written in the script file. Note that paths to various external tools are hardcoded and these tools need to be installed and the paths need to be updated before running the analysis. The required tools are minimap2, guppy, bonito, medaka, racon, rebaler, flye, LFZip, SZ, seqtk. 
- `basecall*.sh`: Perform basecalling with the relevant basecaller (called in `run_exp_basecall_analysis*.sh`).
- `analysis_basecall_accuracy.sh`: Perform basecalling accuracy analysis (called in `run_exp_basecall_analysis*.sh`).
- `assembly*.sh`: Perform assembly and consensus polishing (called in `run_exp_assembly*.sh`).
- `analysis_assembly.sh`: Perform assembly/consensus accuracy analysis (called in `run_exp_assembly_analysis*.sh`).
- `generate_lossy_fast5.py`: Generate new fast5 files with the raw signal replaced by a lossily compressed version (called in `run_exp_generate_fast5.sh`).
- `generate_lossy_fast5_retry.py`: Similar to `generate_lossy_fast5.py`, but used when that script fails (happens due to some hdf5 issues). This script resumes where the other script failed rather than rerunning the whole thing.
- `subsample_fastqs.sh`: subsample fastq file
- `fix_fastq_bonito.py`: used to fix the fastq files generated by seqtk when using bonito. Bonito produces a fasta file and we use seqtk to convert to fastq, but sometimes the basecalling produces an empty sequence and seqtk produces an invalid fastq file.
