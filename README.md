This is a study exploring lossy compression for nanopore raw signal data and the impact on basecall and consensus accuracy. Parts of the analysis pipeline, code and the datasets are obtained from the works on baasecaller comparison in https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison and https://github.com/rrwick/August-2019-consensus-accuracy-update.

Instructions for installing the tools used in the study are available in [`TOOLS.md`](TOOLS.md).

Instructions for downloading the datasets used in the study are available in [`DATASETS.md`](DATASETS.md).

The code and the corresponding README is available in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory.

The data obtained from the analysis in tsv format and the corresponding README is available in the [`data/`](data/) directory.

Plots and jupyter notebooks for generating plots along with the corresponding README is available in the [`plots/`](plots/) directory.
