# Impact of lossy compression of nanopore raw signal data on basecall and consensus accuracy

### [BioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.049262v2)

This is a study exploring lossy compression for nanopore raw signal data and the impact on basecall and consensus accuracy. Parts of the analysis pipeline, code and the datasets are obtained from the works in https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison and https://github.com/rrwick/August-2019-consensus-accuracy-update.

Instructions for installing the tools used in the study are available in [`TOOLS.md`](TOOLS.md).

Instructions for downloading the datasets used in the study are available in [`DATASETS.md`](DATASETS.md).

The code and the corresponding README is available in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory.

The data obtained from the analysis in tsv format and the corresponding README is available in the [`data/`](data/) directory.

Plots and jupyter notebooks for generating plots along with the corresponding README is available in the [`plots/`](plots/) directory.
